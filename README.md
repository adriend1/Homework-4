For this homework assignment I ran into a lot of problems.  I'm uploading what I was able to complete, and recognize that it isn't nearly finished. That being said, I wanted to upload what I have and recieve feedback on it.  That way I can tune the code in the future, after I receive the feedback and fix the problems in my code. 

The main problem I ran into was generating the choices for each question on the project page.  I was able to get the question to pop up after pressing the start button, but not the choices.
